## Authentication and authorization are hard

That's why it's plain stupid to do them yourself.
As a relatively smart guy I use frameworks and libraries written by people smarter then I that invested massive amount of their time into that code.

On my job I get to work with [Apache Shiro][1]. After several attempts to use it's capabilities you often get to implementing something of your own. Like own Realm using NO-SQL db for users/password/roles or in my case ...// todo: describe active directory lookup
